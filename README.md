# BlowBubbleInVR
I made this prototype for a client as a freelancer. This project was made in Unity3D. Assets are freely available on the web. This project involved understanding of Audio Framework of Unity. The player has a Bubble Blowing Stick in one hand, and a chinese fan in the other hand. The player needs to bring the bubble stick near his mouth and blow or make some sound. A bubble is formed as soon as the sound goes above a certain threshold. Once the bubble is formed, the player can blow more in order to increase the size of the bubble. The bubbles can be then flown away by using the Chinese fan in other hand. There are butterflies in the level. The player can use the bubbles to catch them. If they are not in reach, he can use the fan to make the bubbles flow near the butterflies.
